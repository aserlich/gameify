#CREATE THE SIMULATION DATA FOR THE REBINNING OF DATA
#apply a cut of size x to each bin and uniformly sample number
#and then assign them to the bin

#Function that takes in all of the binned data and simulates
#This is the function that is called
#'Function to simulate re-binned counts when each count of a data a bin is considered to come from a uniform distribution
#'and we want to simulate the data as if it comes from a less coarse bin
#'
#'@param counts a matrix of counts of objects placed in bins where each column is a bin and each row is on abservation
#'@param lowerBounds A vector of lower cut points of the original binned data
#'@param upperBounds A vector of the upper cutponts of the original binnned data
#'@param cutSize A scalar that is the the length of the new (less coarse) bin for simulated data
#'@param repNum The number of replications to carry out
#'@param seed Seed
#'@return If \code{simplify=TRUE}, Returns a matrix the same size as the original data however, each cell of the matrix contains a list of simulations.
#'If \code{simplify=FALSE} then the function returns a list where each bin is a list element. Inside each bin there is another list that represents each observation.
#'For all non-empty bins each observation contains \bold{\code{n}} rows, which represent objects places in the bin and \bold{\code{p}} coulmns, were each column represents a simulation. This
#'data structure is designed to be passed to  \code{\link{formatSimsOutput} in order} to get the data in the format you desire for analysis.
#'@details The function uses \code{mapply} to simulate the placing of object within each bin into less coarse bins. It returns an unusual
#'two different unusual data structures. This is good for checking the simulation process but is not useful. Depending on the usage
#'you may want the data in different structures. Use \code{\link{formatSimsOutput}} to get the data in the format you desire
